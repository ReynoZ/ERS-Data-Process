# ERS Data Process
Main target of the assignment 1 has been achieved.

## This program is now able to:

- go through all the sample data in the USGS database, calculate the Euclidean distance between each sample data and my measurement to find a most similar one as a match.
- Plot both the USGS and my measurements in one figure. Seen as below.

![sample5](/fig_sample_5.png)

## Improvements needed:

- Output format needed to be improved(using Regex Expression maybe).
- Use Mahalanobis Distance to improve the matching.
- Use cosine similarity to take figure shape into consideration when matching.
- Better-looking plots.
- Process bar.
